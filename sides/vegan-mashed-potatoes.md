# Vegan Mashed Potatoes

#### Ingredients

- 6-8 medium yukon gold potatoes (if large, cut in half)\*
- 1 1/2 tsp sea salt (divided)
- 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
- 5-6 cloves roasted garlic (or sub minced garlic sautéed for 3 minutes in olive oil)\*
- 3-4 Tbsp vegan butter (such as Earth Balance // melted/softened)

#### Instructions

1. Place potatoes in a large saucepan or pot and cover with water. Bring to a light boil over medium-high heat, add 1 tsp of sea salt.
2. Cover and cook for 25-30 minutes or until very tender. They should effortlessly slide off a knife when pierced with a knife.
3. Once tender, drain your potatoes and place them back in the hot pot off the heat for 1 minute to evaporate any additional water. Then transfer to a large mixing bowl.
4. Mash your potatoes using either a potato masher or a hand mixer until fluffy. Note: Be careful using a hand mixer as you can overmix the potatoes and they can become gluey. It’s personally the method I prefer as I don’t own a potato masher. I just make sure not to overmix.
5. Add in butter, garlic, salt, and black pepper and stir to combine. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.

#### Notes

To roast a head of garlic, simply cup the top off to expose tips, rub with olive oil, wrap in foil and bake for 50 minutes – 1 hour in a 400-degree F (204 C) oven directly on the rack. Cloves should squeeze out easily once cooled. Discard skins/peel.
