# Refried Beans

#### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter or oil
- 1 small white onion, peeled and diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 (15-ounce) cans pinto beans, rinsed and drained
- 1/2 cup vegetable stock
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon chipotle powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 tablespoon freshly-squeezed lime juice
- Fine sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper
- Optional garnishes: finely-chopped fresh cilantro, crumbled or shredded cheese, diced tomato, and/or sliced jalapeño

Yields about 4 servings.

#### Instructions

1. Heat 1 tablespoon butter (or oil) in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until melted. Add the onion and sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened. Add the garlic and sauté for 1-2 more minutes, stirring occasionally, until cooked and fragrant.
2. Add in the pinto beans, vegetable stock, chili powder, chipotle powder, cumin, and oregano, and stir to combine. Continue cooking until the mixture reaches a simmer.
3. Remove pan from heat. Use a potato masher or a wooden spoon to mash the beans to your desired consistency. (Or if you would like them to be super-smooth, you can purée them in a food processor until smooth.)
4. Stir in the remaining tablespoon of butter until it is melted and well-combined. Taste and season the beans with lime juice, salt, and pepper, to taste.
5. Serve warm, topped with any garnishes you like.
