## Roasted Garlic Potato Salad

**Ingredients**

* 2 pounds baby Yukon gold potatoes, unpeeled
* 1 teaspoon table salt, plus salt for cooking potatoes
* ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
* 6 garlic cloves, sliced thin
* 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
* 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar, plus extra for seasoning
* ½ teaspoon pepper
* ½ cup chopped fresh chives, parsley, cilantro, and/or dill

**Steps**

1.  Bring 3 quarts water to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add the potatoes and 3 tablespoons of salt; return to a boil and cook until the potatoes are very tender and easily crushed but not breaking down, about 20 to 25 minutes. Drain the potatoes in a colander and let them sit until cool enough to handle but still warm, about 10 minutes.
2.  Wipe the saucepan clean with damp paper towels. Heat the olive oil and sliced garlic in the now-empty saucepan over medium heat, swirling the oil constantly once the garlic begins to sizzle. Cook until the garlic is light golden brown, about 3 to 5 minutes. Immediately pour the oil and garlic into a large bowl. Add the mayonnaise, sherry vinegar, pepper, and 1 teaspoon of table salt and whisk until smooth.
3.  Using your fingertips, gently tear each potato into rough 1-inch pieces and add them to the bowl with the dressing. Add the chopped fresh herbs and toss until evenly combined. Season with additional salt, pepper, and sherry vinegar to taste. Serve warm, at room temperature, or chilled. (The potato salad can be refrigerated for up to 3 days; season with salt, pepper, and vinegar to taste before serving.)

**Notes**

* Look for potatoes that are similar in size, about 2 inches in diameter.
* You can substitute Red Bliss potatoes for the baby Yukon Gold potatoes.
* You can substitute red or white wine vinegar for the sherry vinegar.
