# Spaghetti Meat Sauce

#### Ingredients

- 1 lb ground beef
- 1 lb ground Italian sausage
- 1 medium onion, chopped (about 1 cup)
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 28 oz can crushed tomatoes
- 15 oz can tomato sauce
- 6 oz can tomato paste
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1.5 tsp dried basil
- 1 tsp
- 1/2 tsp fennel seeds (can be ground)
- 1 bay leaf
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Yields 16 servings.

#### Instructions

1. In a large saucepan, cook the ground beef, sausage, and onion over medium heat until mostly browned, about 5 minutes. Drain if desired. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
2. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, sugar, basil, Italian seasoning, fennel, bay leaf, 1 teaspoon salt, and Â¼ teaspoon pepper. Simmer uncovered for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3. Remove bay leaf. Add more salt and pepper to taste if desired (I like an additional 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, but you may prefer less).
