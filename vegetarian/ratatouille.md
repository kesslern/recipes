# Ratatouille

#### Ingredients

- 2 pounds ripe red tomatoes (6 medium or 4 large)
- 1 medium eggplant (1 pound), diced into ½-inch cubes
- 1 large red, orange, or yellow bell pepper (about 8 ounces), cut into ¾-inch squares
- 1 medium-to-large zucchini (about 8 ounces), diced into ½-inch cubes
- 1 large yellow squash (about 8 ounces), diced into ½-inch cubes
- 5 tablespoons + 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- ¾ teaspoon fine sea salt, divided, more to taste
- 1 medium yellow onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, pressed or minced
- ¼ cup chopped fresh basil
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, more or less to taste
- ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

#### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425°F with one rack in the middle of the oven and one in the upper third.
2. Prepare the tomatoes: remove any woody cores with a paring knife.
   - Manually: Grate them on the large holes of a box grater into a bowl (hold the tomato at a diagonal), and chop any remaining tomato skin.
   - Food processor: Run until smooth.
3. Toss the **eggplant** with olive oil and salt until lightly coated. Arrange in a single layer across a pan.
4. Toss the **bell pepper, zucchini, and yellow squash** with olive oil and salt. Arrange the vegetables in a single layer on another pan.
5. Place the eggplant pan on the middle rack and the other vegetables on the top rack. Set a timer for 15 minutes.
6. Meanwhile, fry the onions with salt and olive oil until browning on the edges, about 8 to 10 minutes.
7. Add the garlic, cook briefly, then deglaze with the tomatoes. Reduce the heat to medium-low and maintain a gentle simmer.
8. After 15 minutes, remove both pans from the oven, stir, and redistribute the contents evenly. Place the eggplant on the top rack and the other vegetables on the middle rack.
9. Bake until the eggplant is golden on the edges, about 10 more minutes (the eggplant will finish before the rest). Remove the eggplant from the oven and stir it into the simmering tomato sauce.
10. Let the squash and bell pepper pan continue to bake until the peppers are caramelized, about 5 to 10 more minutes. Then, transfer those vegetables into the simmering sauce. Simmer for 5 more minutes to meld the flavors.
11. Remove the pot from the heat. Stir in 1 teaspoon olive oil, fresh basil, and red pepper flakes. Crumble the dried oregano between your fingers as you add it. Season to taste with additional salt (usually ¼ teaspoon more) and black pepper.
12. Serve in bowls, optionally drizzled with olive oil, more chopped basil, or black pepper. The flavor improves as it cools and is even better reheated the next day. Ratatouille keeps well in the refrigerator, covered, for 4 days, or for several months in the freezer.
