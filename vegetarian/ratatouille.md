#### Instructions

- Preheat the oven to 425F with one rack in the middle of the oven and one in the upper third of the oven.
- To prepare your tomatoes, remove any woody cores with a paring knife. 
    1. Manually: grate them on the large holes of a box grater into a bowl (this is easiest if you hold the tomato at a diagonal), and chop any remaining tomato skin.
    2. Food processor: run until smooth
- Toss the **eggplant** with olive oil and salt until lightly coated. Arrange in a single layer across the pan.
- Toss the **bell pepper, zucchini and yellow squash** with olive oil and salt. Arrange the vegetables in a single layer.
- Place the eggplant pan on the middle rack and the other vegetables on the top rack. Set the timer for 15 minutes.
- Fry onions with salt and olive oil until browning on the edges, about 8 to 10 minutes.
- Cook the garlic then deglaze with the tomatoes.. Reduce the heat to medium-low and maintain a gentle simmer.
- Once 15 minutes are up, remove both pans from the oven, stir, and redistribute the contents of each evenly across the pans. This time, place the eggplant on the top rack and other vegetables on the middle rack.
- Bake until the eggplant is nice and golden on the edges, about 10 more minutes (the eggplant will be done sooner than the rest). Remove the eggplant from the oven, and carefully stir the eggplant into the simmering tomato sauce.
- Let the squash and bell pepper pan continue to bake until the peppers are caramelized, about 5 to 10 more minutes. Then, transfer the contents of the pan into the simmering sauce. Continue simmering for 5 more minutes to give the flavors time to meld.
- Remove the pot from the heat. Stir in 1 teaspoon olive oil, the fresh basil and red pepper flakes. Crumble the dried oregano between your fingers as you drop it into the pot. Season to taste with additional salt (I usually add ¼ teaspoon more) and black pepper.
- Serve in bowls, perhaps with a little drizzle of olive oil, additional chopped basil, or black pepper on top (all optional). Like all stews, this ratatouille’s flavor improves as it cools. It’s even better reheated the next day. Ratatouille keeps well in the refrigerator, covered, for 4 days, or for several months in the freezer.
