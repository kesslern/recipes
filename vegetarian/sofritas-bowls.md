#### Instructions

1. Drain and cube the tofu.
2. Roast the peppers.
3. Combine the smoked paprika, cumin, dried oregano, onion powder, chili powder, and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Rub the mixture onto the tofu.
4. Saut√© the tofu.
5. In a blender or food processor, combine the roasted poblanos, chipotle peppers, adobo sauce, all but a handful of the tomatoes, tomato paste, onion, garlic, cilantro, sugar, and remaining salt. Blend until smooth.
6. Heat a pan, add oil, then the sauce mixture. Bring to a gentle boil, then add back in the tofu and the beans and reduce to medium-low.
7. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10-15 minutes, or until the tofu is cooked through, beans are warmed, and the sauce reaches the desired consistency. If the sauce reduces too much, simply stir in a bit more water and warm.
8. As the Sofritas cook, squeeze the juice of 1 lime into the cooked white rice. Cover to keep warm.
9. Mash the avocados with the juice of two limes, cilantro, and salt, to taste. Set aside.
10. To serve, build bowls with rice, lettuce, Sofritas, guacamole, and cheese. Garnish with reserved tomato and cilantro.

\* To roast poblanos: Place under a broiler or over a gas flame, turning until blackened on all sides. Place in a bowl and cover to steam for 10 minutes, then peel off the skins.
