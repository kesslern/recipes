#### Instructions

<div data-tasty-recipes-customization="body-color.color" id="bkmrk-drain-and-cube-the-t">1. Drain and cube the tofu
2. Roast the peppers
3. Combine the smoked paprika, cumin, dried oregano, onion powder, chili powder, and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Rub the mixture onto the tofu
4. Saute the tofu
5. In a blender or food processor, combine the roasted pobanos, chipotle peppers, adobo sauce, all but a handful of the tomatoes, tomato paste, onion, garlic, cilantro, sugar, and salt. Blend until smooth.
6. Heat pan, add oil, then the sauce mixture. Bring to a genutle boil, then add back in the tofu and the beans and reduce to medium-low.
7. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10-15 minutes, or until the tofu is cooked through, beans are warmed, and the sauce reaches the desired consistency. If the sauce reduces too much, simply stir in a bit more water and warm.
8. As the Sofritas cook, squeeze the juice of 1 lime into the cooked white rice. Cover to keep warm.
9. Mash the avocados with the juice of two limes, cilantro, and salt, to taste. Set aside.
