## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 300°F.
2. Crush garlic and salt together in a mortar or small bowl. Stir in olive oil and set aside.
3. Tear bread into ~2-inch pieces and spread on a baking sheet. Drizzle with garlic oil and toss to combine.
4. Bake for 25–30 minutes, until bread is dried and edges are crisp.
5. In a mixing bowl, mash 1 can of beans until almost smooth. Add tomatoes and mash into small pieces. Set aside.
6. In a soup pot over medium-high heat, add 2 tablespoons olive oil. Sauté onion, carrot, and celery with a pinch of salt until onion turns translucent (about 4 minutes).
7. Add garlic, oregano, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf. Stir and cook for 1 more minute.
8. Add chicken or vegetable broth. Rinse tomato can with 1/2 cup water and add to the pot. Bring to a simmer over high heat, then reduce to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes.
9. Raise heat to high. When boiling, stir in kale and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
10. Add parsley, remaining can of beans, mashed bean-tomato mixture, black pepper, and cayenne. Rinse tomato bowl with 1 cup water and add to the soup.
11. Add half the toasted bread and 1/4 cup Parmesan. Stir to combine. When it simmers again, reduce heat to medium and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until greens are very tender.
12. Taste and adjust salt as needed.
13. Turn off heat. Add half of the remaining bread on top and press it gently into the soup surface.
14. To serve: ladle soup into bowls and top with remaining toasted bread, grated Parmesan, red chili flakes, chopped parsley, and a drizzle of olive oil. Optional: squeeze fresh lemon juice over top.
